# Welcome to my webpage
My name is Reza. My research focuses on developing machine learning tools to explore interesting information pieces in neuroimaging data (e.g., EEG, MEG, and ERP). Investigating brain activities from various perspectives can provide a better sense of understanding of the brain information processing functions.
