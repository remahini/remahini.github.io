### About Me  
Computational neuroscience and biomedical signal processing, with a focus on EEG/MEG and ERP analysis, spatiotemporal modeling, and consensus-driven clustering methods (hypergraph and deep ensemble approaches). Neural biomarker discovery and characterization, particularly for affective and neurological disorders, using machine learning-based feature engineering and predictive modeling. Real-time prediction and forecasting of brain dynamics, including epilepsy and mental health applications.
